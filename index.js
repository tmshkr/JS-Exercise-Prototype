  TASK 1
    - Write a Person Constructor that initializes `name` and `age` from arguments.
    - All instances of Person should initialize with an empty `stomach` array.
    - Give instances of Person the ability to `.eat("someFood")`:
        + When eating an edible, it should be pushed into the `stomach`.
        + The `eat` method should have no effect if there are 10 items in the `stomach`.
    - Give instances of Person the ability to `.poop()`:
        + When an instance poops, its `stomach` should empty.
    - Give instances of Person a method `.toString()`:
        + It should return a string with `name` and `age`. Example: "Mary, 50"

/* 
  TASK 4

  In your own words explain the four principles of the `this` keyword below:
  
  1. Window/Global Object Binding
  
  When invoked in the global scope, i.e., not bound to any other object, the `this` keyword refers to the `window` object in the browser and the `global` object in Node.

  2. Implicit Binding

  When calling a method on an object, `this` refers to the object preceding the dot before the method invocation. For example, when calling `foo.bar()` the value of `this` is `foo`. Arrow functions, however, are not implicitly bound, so if `foo.baz()` is an arrow function, `this` does not refer to `foo`.

  3. New Binding

  The `new` keyword creates and returns a new object from a constructor function, ignoring any value returned from the function body with the `return` keyword. `this` refers to the new object created from a constructor function. The new object is unique, existing in its own slot in memory.
  
  4. Explicit Binding

  The `call` and `apply` methods, when invoked on a function will explicitly bind the `this` parameter passed in as an argument, allowing us to override an object's implicitly bound `this` to any object.

  For example: https://jsbin.com/boheduy/edit?js,console
